      <p id="text"> 
	&emsp;&emsp; HTTPS is a secure connection for websites that have the purposes of ensuring a <br>  user's security and privacy. HTTPS makes it harder and more limited for people such <br> as the FBI and schools to monitor the activity of users on the internet. In order to get <br> around that they use devices known as HTTPS Proxy Appliances which are a way for <br> people such as the FBI to look into people's activity on the internet. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp; MITM is a man in the middle attack. It is a term used for a perpetrator positions <br> themselves in a conversation between a user and an application. They do this either to <br> eavesdrop or to impersonate one of the parties making the situation seem like a normal <br> exchange. It is risky because whatever information is obtained by the perpetrator could <br> be used for ill-purposes like identity theft.<br>
	&emsp;&emsp; A Hash is a complex mathematical algorithm which carefully processes every <br> single bit of what they <q>digest</q> The essential qualities that make a has a  <br> <q>good</q> hash is that it has sensitive and strong detection of anything changed <br> anywhere in a security certificate. In the case of one bit inside the certificate being <br> changed half of the fingerprint&apos;s hash bits will change as well. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp; CA also known as certificate authorities have the role of proving websites <br> identities in the real world using documentation, their known telephone numbers, etc. <br> After a website proves its identity the CA will put their reputation on the line by digitally <br> signing the siteâ€™s security certificate which contains an assertion of its identity. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp; The SSL interception can not be prevented but it can be detected because it is <br> not possible to completely imitate any security certificate. Public and private keys form <br> cryptographically matched pairs. The SSL security certificates provide the site&apos;s Public <br> key to the public whereas the private one is never disclosed. The interception does not <br> have the private key and they may be able to fake one but it wont match, so the <br> interception is able to be detected. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp; A false-positive is when massive companies distribute multiple security <br> certificates to different servers and websites globally the comparison of the certificates <br> may lead people to thinking that their connection was intercepted. However they have <br> actually just received a different certificate. A false negative is when their connection <br>  was intercepted but was not alerted. <br>
	&emsp;&emsp; In my opinion my school, government, and ISP shouldn&apos;t have the right <br> to eavesdrop on communications. It is an invasion of privacy and ethically wrong. The <br> information that is gathered can be used against <br>  me in the future and it goes against freedom of speech. Also they sell my information to  <br> corporations without my consent. This all makes privacy become obsolete.
