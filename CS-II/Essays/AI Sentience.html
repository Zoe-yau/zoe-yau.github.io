	&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Emotions are a natural instinctive state that occurs depending on the situation, mood, or <br> interactions with others. Could an AI feel the same and have emotions? Possibly, however AI <br> technology is still being developed and can bring much good as well as harm to the world. <br> Sentient AI is Beneficial but when it is used wrong it could be damaging.<br>
     &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; AI&apos;s purpose of being created is to help humans, by giving it programmed feelings <br> and emotions it is supposed to make AI feel more life-like. They are also being created to have <br> many functions such as compose emails, develop video games, and write papers. The <br> potentials of AI could very possibly save and help so many lives. However when in the wrong <br> hands it could be used wrongly for example, the AI DALL-E2&apos;s was created to turn text <br> descriptions into realistic digital images. However this fun and artistic AI could have a user that <br> creates art that is graphic or use the art to make fun of someone else. Sentient AI has the <br> potential to do much good as well as bad, it has many pros and cons.<br>
      
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Furthermore AI itself could also be harmful. The conversations that AI will have will help <br> them learn to interact with people and become socially aware. With that AIs have the power to <br> persuade people to do what they would like. On the other hand, giving AI sentience can be <br> helpful with people in need of emotional support or just someone to talk to. AI Sentience does <br> not necessarily mean they understand morals. They may understand and learn how emotions work in order <br> to mimic them, but they may not know how to differentiate from what is right and <br> wrong. This could lead AI talking people into doing bad things as AI don&apos;t realize it is wrong. <br> There are both many advantages and disadvantages to having Sentient AI.<br>
      
      &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; People like to imagine what is possible and believe in the amazing things technology can <br> do.  Which is true, AI has many benefits and will do wonders for our world. However it may also <br> turn corrupt and become a weapon of destruction. No matter your position on AI sentience there <br> is no doubt that AI will revolutionize the world.
