	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>

	  <li> Rather than techincal issues, we are have a lot that we need to get done. For starters fixing the app layout, currently there are three pages: the map, settings, and a disaster status page. However, the settings and disaster page is blank or have random words on it. Some good news is that the software engineers were able to create place markers on the map. We have made a lot of progress but still have far to go. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <li> We have been communicating much better through our messages group chat. Many of us have lunch at STEAM on B days, so we have started using that lunch time to work on the project. We have been able to talk through the issues of the project and figure out what we want to do next. </li>
	  <br>

	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	  <li> Currently, we are still undecided on color themes, logo designs, and the style of our app. We have two logo designs and disagree on which one we want as the logo. I think to settle the issue we should take a vote. Other than this disagreement the team is working well together. </li>

	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <li> This week we were able to set up the project on xcode for many of the members in our group. For me at first I had issues with my computer and not having enough storage, but I was able to delete some items and easily fix this proble,. When cloning the app from git hub there were inital problems with the maps we were using in the app. However, we were able to fix this problem because we found that there were issues with the netrc file we created before cloning the project. We were also able to decide on a logo, but we need to change colors. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <li> We have a discord server where the group meets to work together on the project. We also have a messages group chat and an email chain where we are able to communicate. We have been working together well and collaborating without many issues. </li>
	  <br>

	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	  <li> There aren't many issues within the group. Everyone is doing their role and working hard to create a succesful app. </li>

	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <li> The issues that we have faced this week is problems with git hub. Unfortunately our README on our github disappeared. However, this issue has a simple fix, we can simply remake it. Although in the future if we have more issues wit our github it may not be so easy to redo. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <li> Conitinuing with the previous journal entries we have not been able to schedule meet ups. This has to do with all of us being very busy. These upcoming months are going to be busy with test preparations or end the year exams. Finding time to have a meet up is proving to be difficut. However, we will be able to find away to have a proper meet up. </li>
	  <br>

	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	  <li> There are currently no interpersonal challenges that we are facing. Everyone is getting along and working together well. I doubt there will be many issues that will arise. </li>

	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <li> We still have the same technical challenges with the design and layout of the app. However, this has to do with a scheduling issue, we just have not have the time to meet and discuss. The other issues that I am facing is with the back end. The concept of our app is a bit challenging and will take some more research for me to know how to contribute to the programming. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <li> We are having many scheduling challengs. For me personally, I have been busy and unable to attened anything we try to set up. I know we all do many after school clubs and have out of school activities which makes it challenging to find free time. However, the sooner we can get together and figure everything out the better.  </li>
	  <br>

	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	  <li> We have resolved our previous issue of trying to figure out roles. Currently there are no challenges or disagreements that I am aware of and everything seems to be operating smoothly. As it is only the beginning more challengs may appear along the way. </li>

	  <h3> Technical Challenges </h3>
	  <li> The technical challenges that I am currently facing is figuring out a design lay out for our app. With multiple people working on the app there is bound to be disagreements. The issues that we are facing is not knowing where to start. We are unsure of what color, theme, and font to go with. We also need to figure out the amount of pages and what kind of pages we want on it. If we are productive and decisive we can solve this issue quickly and create an enticing and inviting app. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <h3> Scheduling Challenges</h3>
	  <li> We have such a large groups, so there may be issues between communication and scheduling conflicts. We have created a group chat with everyone and are figuring out ways to have team meetings. However, scheduling meetings can be hard because everyone has multiple activities going on and the timing of the meetings may not work with their scedule. If we can find ways to create a set scheudle that works for everyone we can be productive and create a successful output. </li> 
	  <br>

	  <h3> Interpersonal Challenges </h3>
	  <li> We are currently working on trying to assign roles to everyone. It is a bit challenging as we have such a big group, it is hard for to figure out what everyone wants to do. A challenge that we have faced is some people want to do the same role as another person or some people want multiple roles or are unsure of what they want at all. In the end, we have come to the conclusion that there will be overlap in roles and multiple people will have the same or similar jobs. </li>
