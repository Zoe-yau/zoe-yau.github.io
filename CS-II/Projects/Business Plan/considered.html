	  <b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/andrew-nguyen/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Restaurant Picker </a> </b>

	  <li> I often have trouble deciding on what to eat, so I find this really useful and helpful. However I&apos;m not sure how the app would incorporate maps and location. Also I could easily input restaurants into a random generator app and have it pick. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	  <b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/kevin-li/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Smartshop </a> </b>

	  <li> I really like this idea because it would be really helpful to people who like to shop and have a distinctive style. It would be really helpful with online shopping and staying current with trends. However, I wouldn’t use this because I like to switch my style often, and I don’t like online shopping. </li>
	  <br>
	  
	<b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/sophie-hews/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Foob </a> </b> 

	    <li> I would use this website when I want to try a new food/meal. However, I am rejecting this proposal because I found a project I am more interested in. Also I don’t cook often, so I wouldn&apos;t use it as much. </li>
	    <br>
	    
	    <b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/jana-daouk/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> The Fit </a> </b> 

	    <li> This project is something that I would use and would enjoy working on. It would be really helpful to have the perfect outfit for the right occasion. However, I rejected the idea because similar ideas were proposed and something like it already exists. </li>

	    	    <br>
	    <b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/shivanshi-das/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Eagle Eats </a> </b> 

	    <li> This idea would be very helpful especially since the cafeteria lines are very long. However, the line to get the food will also be long as the same people will be ordering their food online and waiting to pick it up. The staff will also have to prepare the food ahead of time so any warm food will be cold by the time it gets to the students. </li>

	<b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/joshua-lee/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Facial Recognition Attendance </a> </b> 

	    <li> The reason I considered this is because it would be helpful to the teacher and the students. Many teachers tend to forget to take attendance or make errors, such as counting people absent when they are present. However, I rejected this proposal because I would not helpful in creating the algorithm. </li>

	<b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/danelle-corbita/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Productivity App </a> </b> 

	    <li> I considered this idea because it would be useful and something that could help with organization. However, there are already many apps with a similar concept. Also a lot of people prefer to use a traditional planner and writing out their schedule.  </li>
	    <br>

	    	  
	<b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/brook-asnake/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Organizer App </a> </b> 

	    <li> I really like the idea however apps like this already exist. For example the calendar app which is built into iphones. I usually end up ignoring the notifications on my phone and wouldn't find it useful. </li>
	    <br>
	    	  
	<b> <a href = "https://www.codermerlin.com/users/akshay-vemulapalli/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-III/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> Dx3 </a> </b> 

	    <li> I really like this idea, it would help so much with school and focusing on tasks. However, when I feel myself losing focus or not able to stay away I’ll do things on my own to wake myself up. However, the facial recognition of features could be flawed. For example, the person may be closing their eyes to think or just take a short break, so the system will be alerted and the tasks that follow will be annoying to the user. </li>

	<b> <a href="https://www.codermerlin.com/users/onik-hoque/Digital%20Portfolio/CS-II/Projects/Business%20Plan/index.html" target="_blank"> ShelterSafe </a> </b> <br>

	  <li> I accepted this proposal because I really like the message of it. I think it is really important to bring awareness to get people the help they need especially in the crisis of a natural disaster. I think this will be challenging and I will have much to learn.  I am excited to work on this project and with the people in the group! </li>
